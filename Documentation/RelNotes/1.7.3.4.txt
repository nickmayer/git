Git v1.7.3.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.3.3
--------------------

 * Smart HTTP transport used to incorrectly retry redirected POST
   request with GET request.

 * "git apply" did not correctly handle patches that only change modes
   if told to apply while stripping leading paths with -p option.

 * "git apply" can deal with patches with timezone formatted with a
   colon between the hours and minutes part (e.g. "-08:00" instead of
   "-0800").

 * "git cherry-pick" or "git revert" refused to work when a path that
   would be modified by the operation was stat-dirty without a real
   difference in the contents of the file.

 * "git diff --check" reported an incorrect line number for added
   blank lines at the end of file.

 * Setting log.decorate configuration variable to "0" or "1" to mean
   "false" or "true" did not work.

 * "git tag -v" did not work with GPG signatures in rfc1991 mode.

 * The post-receive-email sample hook was accidentally broken in 1.7.3.3
   update.

Other minor fixes and documentation updates are also included.
