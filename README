Building Git with MSVC
----------------------

Simply run the setup_32bit_env.cmd batch script before opening
running make in GIT_DIR, or opening the generated Vcprojs in
Visual Studio.

The batch script will setup the correct environment variables
required for the build process to find the libraries, and for
running the executables afterwards.
